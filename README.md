* make it easy to distinguish between flags and options provided by terraform and 
those provided by the plugin. Example --out is provided by terraform, and it saves the output of
plan to a binary file for later use. However we want to keep the textual output in a file
as well, so a plugin-specific flag --outAsText is provided. To make it easy to distinguish,
terraform _args_ (such as --out=aFileName.bin) are prefixed with tfNativeArg and becomes --tfNativeArgOut.
Yes, its verbose. Yes its easier to figure out what it means without having to read documentation.

## 0.0.1
* With focus on "terraform plan" and the corresponding custom task Plan a test environment is set up
